# liferay-react-example

*Simple-router* is a very simple react app, with react-router-dom as single dependency.

*React-portlet* is the same react app but in Liferay Portlet context. Because of react-router-dom dependency this portlet produces an
error in the browser dev-console. 

This is just an example, i also ran into problems with another dependencies in Liferay Portlet Context.
